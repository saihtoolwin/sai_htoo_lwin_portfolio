      <p class="text-white mt-4 text-lg">
        I'm a 3rd-year student at the University of Computer Studies, currently
        focusing on web development. Although Iâ€™ve paused my formal education to
        focus more on practical skills, I've been dedicating my time to learning
        and mastering front-end and back-end web technologies. I enjoy turning
        complex requirements into intuitive, user-friendly web applications. My
        goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute to exciting
        projects that make a real impact.
